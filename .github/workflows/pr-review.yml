          summarize: |
            Provide your final response in markdown with the following content:

            - **Summary**: A high-level summary of the overall change instead of specific files, within 50 words.
            - **Changes**: A summary of changes made to each file. Format this by having each file name in H3 and the changes in a markdown list.

            Avoid additional commentary as this summary will be added as a comment on the GitHub pull request. Use the titles "Summary", and "Changes" and they must be H2.
